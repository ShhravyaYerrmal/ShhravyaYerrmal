👋 Hi there, I’m **Shravya Yermal** –   welcome to my GitHub!

🎯 I’m a **curious and driven Data & ML Engineer** with a strong passion for solving complex problems through data. I enjoy building scalable data pipelines, designing insightful dashboards, and exploring the power of machine learning and generative AI to create real-world impact.

⚙️ My toolkit includes **Apache Kafka**, **Apache Spark**, **Airflow**, **Snowflake**, **Kubernetes**, and **Docker** — all leveraged to engineer high-volume, real-time data solutions.

🔍 Always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas — I love turning raw data into actionable insights and seamless systems.

💼 I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow. If you’re looking for someone who’s **enthusiastic, hands-on, and growth-oriented**, I’d love to connect!

📬 Let’s talk!
