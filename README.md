## Hello 

Hoping you are doing great!

It's great to see you. My name is Shravya Yermal.

I am a graduate student at The State University of New York, University at Buffalo pursuing a master's degree in Data Science and Engineering. I am thrilled to announce that I will finish in May 2023.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities. 

With practical experience working in a cloud environment, I have proven expertise in data engineering and analytics. I earned a four-year bachelor's degree in computer science from Walchand Institute of Technology, India. Later, I worked for Infosys Limited, a multinational company that specializes in information technology. 

At the company, I participated in a number of projects. I have several responsibilities such as my role was implementing the data platform and scalable cloud native applications. Building data pipeline, working on complex large scale upstream data quality & lineage issues. I had demonstrated exposure to data deiveries including working on SQL, ETL, Java, SpringBoot, Kafka, Python, PySpark, Spark-Streaming, Spark-SQL, Spark-ML pipelines, NoSQL(Cassandra). I have imbibed good acquintance with cloud environments like AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure, bit of GCP and Snowflakes. 
Automation- writing ansible scripts and playbooks was the major task in one of the projects.

My professional experience also involved performing analysis of vast data stores and uncover the essential insights. Many a time, unknown formats came across were made workable & usable. I have worked on live projects, where I had encountered with pipeline failures, query optimization, rectification & related troubleshooting. 

In the diverse workforce, I had drove the delivery and led a ream of 3 subordinates working on development of data pipelines to support operational processes, analytics & reporting use cases in efficient manner. Optimization was my expertise and I was also recognized the only Certified Kafka Developer within the team. 

While getting exposure to the business world, I noticed a passion to learn more about data & statistics. I arrived at the State University of New York at Buffalo to pursue a degree in Data Science. Overall including my scholastic and career endeavors, I would say that I have had about 8 years of experience overall.

I would like to arrange an appointment to learn more if you are recruiting, hiring, or have an opening in your team.
