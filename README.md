## Hello 

Hoping you are doing great!

It's great to see you. My name is Shravya Yermal.

I graduated from The State University of New York, University at Buffalo. 

With practical experience working in a cloud and reliability environment. At the organization, I have participated in several projects and had many responsibilities such as implementing the data platform and scalable cloud-native applications and building data pipelines, working on complex large-scale upstream data quality & lineage issues. I have demonstrated exposure to data deliveries including working on SQL, ETL, Kafka, Python, and NoSQL(Cassandra). I have imbibed good acquaintance with cloud environments like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

My professional experience also involved performing analysis of vast data stores and uncovering essential insights. Many a time, unknown formats came across were made workable & usable. I have worked on live projects, where I encountered pipeline failures, query optimization, rectification & related troubleshooting. 

In the diverse workforce, I drove the production delivery leading a team of 3 subordinates. My team worked on the data pipeline development to support operational processes, analytics & reporting use cases efficiently. Optimization was my expertise and I was also recognized as the only Certified Kafka Developer within the team. 

While acquiring exposure to the business world, I noticed a passion for learning more about data & statistics.
