## Hello 

Hoping you are doing great!

It's great to see you. My name is Shravya Yermal.

I am a graduate of The State University of New York, University at Buffalo. I am thrilled to announce that I have completed my master's degree in Data Science and Engineering.

With practical experience working in a cloud environment, I have proven expertise in Data Engineering and Analytics. I earned a four-year bachelor's degree in computer science from Walchand Institute of Technology, India. Later, I worked for Infosys Limited, a multinational company that specializes in information technology. 

At the company, I participated in a number of projects. I have several responsibilities such as my role was implementing the data platform and scalable cloud-native applications. Building data pipeline, working on complex large-scale upstream data quality & lineage issues. I had demonstrated exposure to data deliveries including working on SQL, ETL, Java, SpringBoot, Kafka, Python, PySpark, Spark-Streaming, Spark-SQL, Spark-ML pipelines, and NoSQL(Cassandra). I have imbibed good acquaintance with cloud environments like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

Automation: writing ansible scripts and playbooks was the major task in one of the projects.

My professional experience also involved performing analysis of vast data stores and uncovering essential insights. Many a time, unknown formats came across were made workable & usable. I have worked on live projects, where I encountered with pipeline failures, query optimization, rectification & related troubleshooting. 

In the diverse workforce, I drove the delivery and led a team of 3 subordinates working on the development of data pipelines to support operational processes, analytics & reporting use cases in an efficient manner. Optimization was my expertise and I was also recognized as the only Certified Kafka Developer within the team. 

While getting exposure to the business world, I noticed a passion to learn more about data & statistics. I arrived at the State University of New York at Buffalo to pursue a degree in Data Science. Overall including my scholastic and career endeavors, I would say that I have had about 7+ years of experience.

I would like to schedule an appointment to learn more if you are recruiting, hiring, or have an opening in your team.

Looking forward to your response. Please email me at shhravyayerrmal@gmail.com. 

Best Wishes, Shravya Yermal.
