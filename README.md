👋 Hi there, 

I’m Shravya Yermal – welcome to my GitHub!

🎯 I’m a curious and driven Data & ML Engineer with a strong passion for solving complex problems through data. I enjoy building scalable data pipelines, designing insightful dashboards, and exploring the power of machine learning and generative AI to create real-world impact.

🔍 Always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas — from Airflow and Snowflake to Kubernetes and GenAI — I love turning data into meaningful stories and solutions.

💼 I’m actively seeking opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow. If you’re looking for someone who’s enthusiastic, hands-on, and growth-oriented, I’d love to connect!

📬 Let’s talk!
