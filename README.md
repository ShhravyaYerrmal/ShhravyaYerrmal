## Hello 

Hoping you are doing great!

It's great to see you. My name is Shravya Yermal.

I am a graduate of The State University of New York, University at Buffalo. 

With practical experience working in a cloud and reliability environment. At the organization, I have participated in several projects. I have several responsibilities such as my role was implementing the data platform and scalable cloud-native applications. Building data pipeline, working on complex large-scale upstream data quality & lineage issues. I had demonstrated exposure to data deliveries including working on SQL, ETL, Java, SpringBoot, Kafka, Python, PySpark, Spark-Streaming, Spark-SQL, Spark-ML pipelines, and NoSQL(Cassandra). I have imbibed good acquaintance with cloud environments like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes. 

My professional experience also involved performing analysis of vast data stores and uncovering essential insights. Many a time, unknown formats came across were made workable & usable. I have worked on live projects, where I encountered pipeline failures, query optimization, rectification & related troubleshooting. 

In the diverse workforce, I drove the delivery and led a team of 3 subordinates working on the development of data pipelines to support operational processes, analytics & reporting use cases efficiently. Optimization was my expertise and I was also recognized as the only Certified Kafka Developer within the team. 

While getting exposure to the business world, I noticed a passion for learning more about data & statistics.
